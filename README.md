# peachwww

This is the source code for [peachwww.com](http://peachwww.com), an unofficial web client for Peach.

## Purpose

One of our goals for Peach is to be a great for developers. I'd like to make sure we do that by building on it myself. 

**This project will only ever use APIs and methods that 3rd party developers have access to.** This makes us more sensitive to developers on Peach.

I'd like to ensure my needs align with the needs of Peach developers, which will help us to respond to them quickly and appropriately.

This project may be forked as the basis for an official client in the future, but right now we don't have the bandwidth to build or support one. So it's a personal project for now.

## Status

Very early. Can't make too many promises about the quality of the code, but I'm trying!

## Features

- **Read-only** right now. Account creation and post creation are both unsupported in the current version

- Automatically refreshes, so it's nice to leave open in a tab somewhere

- Chat-ish interface

- Use the L/R arrow keys to navigate through people

### Installation
